<p>In this short article, I will provide a setup guide for successfully running Godot with C#. Godot is a game engine that supports both 2D and 3D graphics, as well as multiple languages. While language support for C# is still in the works, it may be useful for someone looking to transition from the Unity game engine to Godot.</p>
<p>Step 1:<br>As a first step, make sure to download the Godot mono version from the game engine's website or click the link below.</p>
<p><a href="https://godotengine.org/download">Godot Engine - Download | Windows</a></p>
